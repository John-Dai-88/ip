## Setting up and Running Jarvis
1. Download the latest java executable (.jar file) from [here](https://github.com/John-Dai-88/ip/releases)
2. Place it in your desired directory
3. Open a command prompt terminal and navigate to the directory the java executable file is located in
4. Run the command `java-jar jarvis.jar`
* Alternatively, double-click the java executable to run the program

If successful, Jarvis will open a desktop window similar to the image above.

Jarvis stores tasks in`data/jarvis.txt` which is located within the same directory as the JAR executable

### Understanding the parameters
**⚠ All parameters and commands are case-insensitive**

**⚠ Follow the format EXACTLY as seen in the table or the program might not recognize the command**

- **For all task command** : The `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` parameter refers to an arbitrary task name

- **For deadline and event command** : Both date-only and date-and-time formats are supported, allowing users to choose whichever format best suits their needs.

- **For deadline and event command** : For the `<yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM>` parameter
    - yyyy refers to year
    - mm refers to month
    - dd refers to day
    - HH refers to hour (in 24-hour format)
    - MM refers to minutes (in 24-hour format)
  
- **For mark, unmark and delete command** : The `<VALID_TASK_NUMBER>` parameter is referring to the task index numbers from the output of `list` (Refer below for examples)

  ![Sample photo of task index numbers](https://john-dai-88.github.io/ip/ValidTaskNumberParamReference.png)
  - To mark/unmark/delete `[T][X] Buy a book`, the task number to insert into <ValidTaskNumber> would be 1
  - Likewise for `[D][] Submit assignment (by: 09 14 2026 23:59)`, the task number to use would be 3
  
- **For find command** : The `<KEY_WORD>` parameter has to be of minimally 2 characters long

## Data Storage and Management

### Data Saving
Jarvis automatically saves the data to `data/jarvis.txt` relative to the folder `jarvis.jar` is ran from

###  Data Migration
Retain `jarvis.txt` and store it within the `data` folder relative to the folder of the new Jarvis release

### Importing Data
Users can directly edit `jarvis.txt` and manually update it with data

Please also ensure that data is stored in one of the following formats
- Todo task : `[T][] <TASK DESCRIPTION>` or `[T][X] <TASK DESCRIPTION>`
- Deadline task (Date only) : `[D][] <TASK DESCRIPTION> /by <yyyy-mm-dd>` or `[D][X] <TASK DESCRIPTION> /by <yyyy-mm-dd>`
- Deadline task (Date & Time) : `[D][] <TASK DESCRIPTION> /by <yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM>` or `[D][X] <TASK DESCRIPTION> /by <yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM>`
- Event task (Date only) : `[E][] <TASK_DESCRIPTION> /from <yyyy-mm-dd> /to <yyyy-mm-dd>` or `[E][X] <TASK_DESCRIPTION> /from <yyyy-mm-dd> /to <yyyy-mm-dd>`
- Event task (Date & Time) : `[E][] <TASK_DESCRIPTION> /from <yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM> /to <yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM>` or `[E][X] <TASK_DESCRIPTION> /from <yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM> /to <yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM>`

## Troubleshooting
### Jarvis is unable to start up
Cause : Java version is most likely missing from your local machine

Remedy : Run `java -version` in your command terminal and confirm installed java version is 25

If java is not installed, follow this [java installation guide](https://nus-cs2103-ay2627-s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html)

### Missing tasks from stored tasks
Cause : Jarvis executable is most likely not in the same folder as `data/jarvis.txt`

Remedy : Verify that the Jarvis jar executable file is located in the same folder you ran from previously

As Jarvis reads tasks from `data/jarvis.txt` relative to the folder it os located in

### Command is not executed properly
Cause : Command format inputted by user does not match the program's format

Remedy : Please follow the command format specified in the *Command Appendix* table **EXACTLY**

### Imported task is not read properly
Cause : Imported task data format is malformed or missing certain parameters

Remedy : Please follow the task data follows the format specified in the *Importing Data* section **EXACTLY**
, else the program will skip reading that task
